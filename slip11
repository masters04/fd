Q1 Develop an Express.js application that defines routes for Create operations 
on a resource (Movie).
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware for parsing JSON bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// In-memory "database" to store users
let movies= [];

// Create a new user (Create)
app.post('/ movies ', (req, res) => {
  const { name, actro} = req.body;
  const newmovies = { id: movies.length + 1, name, email };
  movies.push(newmovies);
  res.status(201).json(newmovies);
});

app.get('/ movies ', (req, res) => {
  res.json(movies);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
